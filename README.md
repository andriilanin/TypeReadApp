# TypeFocus — A Tool for Improving Concentration and Typing Skills

## Project Description

TypeFocus is a lightweight, user-friendly reading assistant designed specifically for individuals who struggle with focus and concentration. The application allows you to paste any text from the clipboard or open FB2-format eBooks. As the user types, the text—initially displayed in light gray—gradually turns black letter by letter, providing a clear, step-by-step reading and typing experience.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Progressive Text Coloring**: Each character you type transforms from gray to black, guiding your attention and preventing distractions.
- 📖 **Flexible Text Input**: Paste text directly from your clipboard or import entire books in FB2 format.
- ⌨️ **Typing Practice**: Enhance your typing speed and accuracy while you read.

## Installation

   ```bash
   Download TypeReadApp installer from releases.
   ```

## Usage

1. Past text from clipboard by pressing **ctrl+V**, or in options(ctrl+O) choose **Open book file**, and select your **FB2** book file.
2. Load your text or book.
3. Start typing in the input pane; the text will progressively reveal itself.
4. Your reading progress is saved to the local database.

## Psychological Benefits

1. **Enhanced Focus**: The gradual reveal of text encourages sustained attention on one character at a time, minimizing mind-wandering.
2. **Cognitive Engagement**: Simultaneous reading and typing activate visual, tactile, and motor pathways, strengthening neural connections.
3. **Reduced Anxiety**: Breaking down reading into bite-sized tasks makes large volumes of text feel more manageable and less overwhelming.
4. **Positive Feedback Loop**: Seeing text turn black with each keystroke provides instant gratification and reinforces progress.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C++
- **Framework**: Qt
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON database for session logs and statistics.
